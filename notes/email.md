# This is the Email for seeking help to implement euclidean neural network

Dear Dr. Tess Smid,

Thank you so much for the talk about euclidean symmetry for the summer event at LBL . I am Md Shahrier Hasan, A PhD student currently working as summer intern with my advisor Dr. Wenwu Xu and Dr. Bert De Jong at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab. We are trying to improve  a neural network based constitutive model development procedure (reference paper attached). The goal is to tailor the modeling procedure to predict constitutive relationship between the nano-scale inclusion and macro-scale failure in the material class known as Metal Matrix Nano-composites(reference proposal attached).

In this project we have two types of Neural Network(NN). One is Defect Classification NN model with scaler output(defect mode) and stress regression model with vector output(stress vector). In both NN models, input is strain vector.  

We are exploring the possibility of utilizing the symmetry in the data by making the classification nn model frame invariant and the stress regression nn model equivariant to reduce the training data required. I would really appreciate your comments and feedback about the feasibility implementing this idea.  

Thank you so much.

Best Regards,
Md Shahrier Hasan


Hi Tess,

Thank you so much for taking the time to read my problem providing your insight. You are correct that I am trying to implement multi-scale modeling by linking the atomistic scale (point representation) and continuum scale( Mesh representation) togather through symmetry aware neural networks. I have been going through all the materials provided for the implementation of enn in your enn repository and its quite a steep learning curve for me. So thank so much for offering your guidance. I will keep my questions as specific as I can.   

Finally, Congratulations and best of luck for you future endeavour in Boston! 

Best,

Shahrie
