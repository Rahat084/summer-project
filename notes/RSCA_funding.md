# Abstract of the project for general public

Mechanical failure of materials can have a catastrophic consequences in our day to day life. With the addition of nano sized inclusions in materials known as nano-composites, it is possible to tailor how a critical component of a device fails. To establish this relation between nano-scale inclusion and engineering scale failure, a reliable multi-scale modeling technique is necessary. In this work, this relationship is established by combining two computational technique Molecular Dynamics(MD) and Finite Element Method(FEM) with machine learning based homogenization scheme. This computational technique will provide opportunity to predict optimized design of nano-composite before the long drawn out process of synthesizing it.

# Benefit of the project to the field of study/inquiry

This project introduces an new multi-scale computational technique to design nano-composites tailored for desired dynamic failure properties.

# What is new an exiting to share : Research finding, skills I have used etc

In this project we have used state of the art machine learning technique for multi-scale modeling. This combined computational and data-driven technique is at its infancy and may open-up a lot of new research avenue for the future in the domain of computational material science. 

# The challenges I faced in my project goals

The challenges faced while working toward my project goals were many. Such as:

1. The expertise required for optimizing the data and in turn the data driven model. 
2. The limitation of the computational resources for running the simulations with high computational cost.
3. The lack of similar work in literature for reference purposes.
